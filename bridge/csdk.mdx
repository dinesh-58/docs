To use the SQLite Bridge in your code just replace the SQLite amalgamation files with the SQLite Bridge files (sqlite.h and sqlite.c) and link your project with the libtls shared library using the following gcc option flags: 

- Download the official SQLite Cloud Bridge C files from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/tree/master/SQLiteBridge)

- Add the libressl dir to the list of directories to be searched for: -L&ltpath-to-libressl-lib>. Examples: 

  Linux: `-L/usr/local/libressl/lib/` 

  macOS: `-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libressl/lib`

- Make the library available at runtime with the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH or rpath. Example: `-Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/libressl/lib/` 

- Link the shared library: `-ltls`
