The official SQLite library offers 321 public APIs, and all of them are supported in the SQLite bridge.

We developed an open-source bridge (based on SQLite Cloud official C SDK) enabling you to use the SQLite API with our cloud solution transparently. Some API does not make sense in a cloud environment (like VFS-related API, for example), so we added stub functions to make your compiler happy.

The SQLite Cloud Bridge is open-source and freely available in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/tree/master/SQLiteBridge).
