SQLite Cloud supports all the native SQLite extensions ([sqlean](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean) on GitHub offers a sample list), allowing you to take advantage of all new functionality that others have added to SQLite.

SQLite Cloud also includes a powerful and high-performance WASM engine that enables you to add business logic by developing server-side functions in C, Rust, Javascript, GO, and several other languages.
