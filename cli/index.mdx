The **SQLite Cloud Command Line Interface** is a user-friendly interface that runs on the terminal and acts as a front-end to SQLite Cloud. This interface allows you to enter queries interactively, submit them to SQLite Cloud, and view the resulting data. Additionally, input can come from a file or command line arguments, giving you greater flexibility in how you interact with SQLite Cloud.

It's worth noting that there are two versions of the CLI available: one written in C and one written in GO. Both versions offer the same functionality, and the source code is provided for both. The C version was the first to be developed and was extensively used during the development of SQLite Cloud. It's based on the C SDK. The GO version, on the other hand, was created later, after the GO SDK was released. In the future, we plan to combine both projects into a unified CLI.

* Binaries can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/releases).
* C source code can be downloaded from the [C SDK repo](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/tree/master/C).
* GO source code can be downlaoded from the [GO SDK repo](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/tree/master/GO).

The C cli (sqlitecloud-cli) is available for Linux (x86) and macOS (Intel and ARM).

The GO cli (sqlc) is available for Linux (x86), Windows (x86) and macOS (Intel and ARM).

## sqlitecloud-cli (C)
**sqlitecloud-cli** is a terminal-based front-end to SQLite Cloud written in C. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to SQLite Cloud, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments.

In addition, **sqlitecloud-cli** provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks. Meta-commands begin with a dot.

## Options
```bash
-v                    print usage and exit
-h HOSTNAME           hostname to connect to (default localhost)
-p PORT               port to connect to (default 8860)
-f FILEPATH           file path with commands to execute
-d DATABASE           database name
-r ROOT_CERTIFICATE   path to root certificate for TLS connection
-s CLI_CERTIFICATE    path to client certificate for TLS connection
-t CLI_KEY            path to client key certificate for TLS connection
-u TIMEOUT            connection timeout in seconds (default no timeout)
-y IP                 connection type (IPv4, IPv6 or IPany, default IPv4)
-n USERNAME           authentication username
-m PASSWORD           authentication password
-c                    activate compression
-i                    activate insecure mode (non TLS connection)
-q                    activate quite mode (disable output print)
-x                    activate special sqlite mode
-z                    request zero-terminated strings in all replies
```


## sqlc (GO)

**sqlc** is a terminal-based front-end to SQLite Cloud written in GO. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to SQLite Cloud, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments.

In addition, **sqlc** provides various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks.

## Options
```bash
> ./sqlc --help

Usage:
  sqlc [URL] [options] [<FILE>...]
  sqlc -?|--help|--version

Arguments:
  URL       "sqlitecloud://user:pass@host.com:port/dbname?timeout=10&compress=NO"
  FILE...   Execute SQL commands from FILE(s) after connecting to the SQLite Cloud database

Examples:
  sqlc "sqlitecloud://user:pass@host.com:8860/dbname?timeout=10&compress=lz4&tls=intern"
  sqlc --host hostname -u user --password=pass -d dbname -c LZ4 --tls=no
  sqlc --version
  sqlc -?

General Options:
  --cmd COMMAND            Run "COMMAND" before executing FILE... or reading from stdin
  -l, --list               List available databases, then exit
  -d, --dbname NAME        Use database NAME
  -b, --bail               Stop after hitting an error
  -?, --help               Show this screen
  --version                Display version information

Output Format Options:
  -o, --output FILE        Switch to BATCH mode, execute SQL Commands and send output to FILE, then exit.
                           In BATCH mode, the default output format is switched to QUOTE.
  
  --echo                   Disables --quiet, print command(s) before execution
  --quiet                  Disables --echo, run command(s) quietly (no messages, only query output)
  --noheader               Turn headers off
  --nullvalue TEXT         Set text string for NULL values [default: "NULL"]
  --newline SEP            Set output row separator [default: "\r\n"]
  --separator SEP          Set output column separator [default: "|"]
  --format (LIST|CSV|QUOTE|TABS|LINE|JSON|HTML|XML|MARKDOWN|TABLE|BOX)
                           Specify the Output mode [default: BOX]

Connection Options:
  -h, --host HOSTNAME      Connect to SQLite Cloud database server host name [default: localhost]
  -p, --port PORT          Use specified port to connect to SQLIte Cloud database server [default: 8860]
