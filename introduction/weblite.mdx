## Overview
Weblite is an auto-generated RESTful API layer that lets you interact with your SQLite Cloud databases and edge functions via HTTP/JSON request/responses.

Weblite is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and flexible. It is similar to PostgREST, but does not require any installation or setup.



## Features
#### Auto-generated
- **Seamless Integration**: Weblite integrates directly into your SQLite Cloud, requiring no additional installations. It runs on your own nodes, ensuring that your environment is fully controlled and consistent with your infrastructure.
- **Automatic Updates**: Changes made to your database schema are instantly available through the API, allowing for dynamic application development without downtime.

#### Stateless and Scalable
- **High Performance**: Weblite is designed to be as scalable as your cluster. The performance is only limited by your nodeâ€™s capabilities and configuration, supporting extensive scalability without traditional bottlenecks.
- **Stateless Architecture**: Ensures that each API call is independent, enhancing reliability and performance. For transaction-like functionality, developers can utilize [Edge Functions](/introduction/edge_functions) to encapsulate custom logic.

#### Secure and Developer-Friendly
- **Edge Functions**: Write server-side logic and directly within your API, enabling the creation of complex backend functionalities seamlessly integrated with your database operations.
- **Developer Tools**: Includes built-in commands and support for any SQL statement and [SQLite Cloud command](https://docs.sqlitecloud.io/docs/commands).

#### Fast and Efficient
- **Rapid Development**: Start interacting with your database immediately using the auto-generated REST endpoints. Ideal for developing proofs of concept or hobby projects quickly.
- **Enhanced Data Handling**: Supports all CRUD operations and allows for complex SQL queries and commands to be executed via the REST API

## Security
While Weblite does not implement row-level security to focus on performance and stateless operations, it ensures data integrity and secure access through controlled endpoint exposure and secure API gateways.

## Getting Started
Navigate to the ""Development" section in the SQLite Cloud console. From here, you have access to all weblite endpoints and can start interacting with your database via HTTP/JSON requests.
