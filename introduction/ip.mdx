title: IP Restrictions
description: Dashboard IP Restrictions

The IP Restrictions panel enables the restriction of access for a role or user by allowing only specific IP addresses or ranges in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) (for example 10.10.10.0/24). Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.

To add a new IP restriction to a user or role, click on the **Add IP** button.
