### Projects

A project represents a logical name for your database cluster. If you're looking to set up a cluster for your warehouse, then a fitting name could be **MyWarehouse** or **MyCompany**. For your flagship mobile app, you might choose **MyAwesomeApp**. The SQLite Cloud dashboard permits you to create and manage multiple projects (clusters) according to your needs.

Each project can be configured independently to suit your specific requirements. For instance, **MyAwesomeApp** could be a complex, 127-node cluster distributed worldwide, while **MyWarehouse** could be a simpler 3-node cluster situated near your headquarter in New York.

### Create a New Project

To create a new project, simply click on the "New Project" button. A dialogue box will appear, allowing you to specify a project name and choose a deployment region for your node.

In this beta version, projects are limited to the **Hobby Tier** plan, and you can deploy only one node initially. However, you retain the flexibility to adjust the number of nodes later in the [Nodes](/docs/introduction/nodes) section as needed.

<Callout type="warning" title="Administrator Password">
It is a good idea to write your Administrator Password somewhere because it is the password you can use to directly connect to any node using the  [sqlitecloud-cli](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/releases) or the [SDK](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk).
