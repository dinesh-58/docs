After creating a Project and adding nodes to your cluster, the next step is to add SQLite databases. If you already have databases that you want to share, simply select **Upload Database**, and within a few minutes, your databases will be up and running on your cluster. It's worth noting that you can also upload encrypted SQLite databases if you used the official [SEE SQLite encryption extension](https://www.sqlite.org/see/doc/release/www/index.wiki).

A sample Chinook database is included for your convenience. For more information about the Chinook sample database, refer to its official [repo](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).

Alternatively, select **Create Database**, and fill in the required details. The only mandatory field is the database name; all other fields are optional. The default encoding is set to UTF-8, and the default page size is 4096KB. If no encryption key is set, your database will not be encrypted.

Once you're done, your Databases panel will look like this:

In addition to the more obvious columns, such as database **Name** and **Size**, there are other useful columns:
* The **Connections** column reports how many clients are connected to the database.
* The **Encryption** columns reports infomation about the encryption algorithm used in the database.
* The **Backup** column shows whether a backup option is enabled for the database.
* The **Read/Write** column reports the number of read/write operations performed on the database.
* The **Bytes Out/In** column reports the number of input/output bytes generated by the database.
* The **Fragmentation** column reports a fragmentation value for the database.

The action menu contains links to the following features:
* **Download** which allows you to download the database.
* **Tables** where you can see a list of all the tables contained within the database.
* **Encyption** where you edit encryption options.
* **Backup** where you can access the [Backup](/docs/introduction/backup) section.
* **Delete Database** which lets you delete the database.
