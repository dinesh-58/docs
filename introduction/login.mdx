To access the SQLite Cloud Dashboard, you must have login credentials. If you do not have these credentials, you can register for a new account on the [SQLite Cloud website](https://sqlitecloud.io/register).

Once you have successfully logged in to the [SQLite Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.sqlitecloud.io), you will see an empty navigation bar on the left-hand side of the screen. This bar is ready and waiting for you to add your [projects](/docs/introduction/projects).
