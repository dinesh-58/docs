## 1. Syntax

<!-- do-not-touch-svg-import: 'createtable.svg' -->

## 2. The CREATE TABLE command

The "CREATE TABLE" command is used to create a new table in an SQLite
database. A CREATE TABLE command specifies the following attributes of
the new table:

- The name of the new table.

- The database in which the new table is created. Tables may be created
  in the main database, the temp database, or in any attached database.

- The name of each column in the table.

- The declared type of each column in the table.

- A default value or expression for each column in the table.

- A default collation sequence to use with each column.

- Optionally, a PRIMARY KEY for the table. Both single column and
  composite (multiple column) primary keys are supported.

- A set of SQL constraints for each table. SQLite supports UNIQUE, NOT
  NULL, CHECK and FOREIGN KEY constraints.

- Optionally, a
  <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html" target="_blank">generated
  column</a> constraint.

- Whether the table is a
  <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html"
  target="_blank">WITHOUT ROWID</a> table.

- Whether the table is subject to
  <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html"
  target="_blank">strict type checking</a>.

Every CREATE TABLE statement must specify a name for the new table.
Table names that begin with "sqlite\_" are reserved for internal use. It
is an error to attempt to create a table with a name that starts with
"sqlite\_".

If a <span class="yyterm">schema-name</span> is specified, it must be
either "main", "temp", or the name of an [attached
database](lang_attach). In this case the new table is created in the
named database. If the "TEMP" or "TEMPORARY" keyword occurs between the
"CREATE" and "TABLE" then the new table is created in the temp database.
It is an error to specify both a <span class="yyterm">schema-name</span>
and the TEMP or TEMPORARY keyword, unless the
<span class="yyterm">schema-name</span> is "temp". If no schema name is
specified and the TEMP keyword is not present then the table is created
in the main database.

It is usually an error to attempt to create a new table in a database
that already contains a table, index or view of the same name. However,
if the "IF NOT EXISTS" clause is specified as part of the CREATE TABLE
statement and a table or view of the same name already exists, the
CREATE TABLE command simply has no effect (and no error message is
returned). An error is still returned if the table cannot be created
because of an existing index, even if the "IF NOT EXISTS" clause is
specified.

It is not an error to create a table that has the same name as an
existing [trigger](lang_createtrigger).

Tables are removed using the [DROP TABLE](lang_droptable) statement.

## 2.1. CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT Statements

A "CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT" statement creates and populates a
database table based on the results of a SELECT statement. The table has
the same number of columns as the rows returned by the SELECT statement.
The name of each column is the same as the name of the corresponding
column in the result set of the SELECT statement. The declared type of
each column is determined by the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#expraff"
target="_blank">expression affinity</a> of the corresponding expression
in the result set of the SELECT statement, as follows:

| Expression Affinity | Column Declared Type |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| TEXT                | "TEXT"               |
| NUMERIC             | "NUM"                |
| INTEGER             | "INT"                |
| REAL                | "REAL"               |
| BLOB (a.k.a "NONE") | "" (empty string)    |

A table created using CREATE TABLE AS has no PRIMARY KEY and no
constraints of any kind. The default value of each column is NULL. The
default collation sequence for each column of the new table is BINARY.

Tables created using CREATE TABLE AS are initially populated with the
rows of data returned by the SELECT statement. Rows are assigned
contiguously ascending [rowid](lang_createtable#rowid) values, starting
with 1, in the [order](lang_select#orderby) that they are returned by
the SELECT statement. <span id="tablecoldef"></span>

## 3. Column Definitions

Unless it is a CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT statement, a CREATE TABLE
includes one or more
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/column-def.html"
target="_blank">column definitions</a>, optionally followed by a list of
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/table-constraint.html"
target="_blank">table constraints</a>. Each column definition consists
of the name of the column, optionally followed by the declared type of
the column, then one or more optional
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/column-constraint.html"
target="_blank">column constraints</a>. Included in the definition of
"column constraints" for the purposes of the previous statement are the
COLLATE and DEFAULT clauses, even though these are not really
constraints in the sense that they do not restrict the data that the
table may contain. The other constraints - NOT NULL, CHECK, UNIQUE,
PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints - impose restrictions on the
table data.

The number of columns in a table is limited by the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html#max_column"
target="_blank">SQLITE_MAX_COLUMN</a> compile-time parameter. A single
row of a table cannot store more than
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/limits.html#max_length"
target="_blank">SQLITE_MAX_LENGTH</a> bytes of data. Both of these
limits can be lowered at runtime using the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/limit.html"
target="_blank">sqlite3_limit()</a> C/C++ interface.

## 3.1. Column Data Types

Unlike most SQL databases, SQLite does not restrict the type of data
that may be inserted into a column based on the columns declared type.
Instead, SQLite uses
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html" target="_blank">dynamic
typing</a>. The declared type of a column is used to determine the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity"
target="_blank">affinity</a> of the column only.
<span id="dfltval"></span>

## 3.2. The DEFAULT clause

The DEFAULT clause specifies a default value to use for the column if no
value is explicitly provided by the user when doing an
[INSERT](lang_insert). If there is no explicit DEFAULT clause attached
to a column definition, then the default value of the column is NULL. An
explicit DEFAULT clause may specify that the default value is NULL, a
string constant, a blob constant, a signed-number, or any constant
expression enclosed in parentheses. A default value may also be one of
the special case-independent keywords CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_DATE or
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. For the purposes of the DEFAULT clause, an expression
is considered constant if it contains no sub-queries, column or table
references, [bound parameters](lang_expr#varparam), or string literals
enclosed in double-quotes instead of single-quotes.

Each time a row is inserted into the table by an INSERT statement that
does not provide explicit values for all table columns the values stored
in the new row are determined by their default values, as follows:

- If the default value of the column is a constant NULL, text, blob or
  signed-number value, then that value is used directly in the new row.

- If the default value of a column is an expression in parentheses, then
  the expression is evaluated once for each row inserted and the results
  used in the new row.

- If the default value of a column is CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_DATE or
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, then the value used in the new row is a text
  representation of the current UTC date and/or time. For CURRENT_TIME,
  the format of the value is "HH:MM:SS". For CURRENT_DATE, "YYYY-MM-DD".
  The format for CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".

<span id="collateclause"></span>

## 3.3. The COLLATE clause

The COLLATE clause specifies the name of a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation"
target="_blank">collating sequence</a> to use as the default collation
sequence for the column. If no COLLATE clause is specified, the default
collation sequence is
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation"
target="_blank">BINARY</a>.

## 3.4. The GENERATED ALWAYS AS clause

A column that includes a GENERATED ALWAYS AS clause is a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html" target="_blank">generated
column</a>. Generated columns are supported beginning with SQLite
version 3.31.0 (2020-01-22). See the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/gencol.html" target="_blank">separate
documentation</a> for details on the capabilities and limitations of
generated columns. <span id="primkeyconst"></span>

## 3.5. The PRIMARY KEY

Each table in SQLite may have at most one PRIMARY KEY. If the keywords
PRIMARY KEY are added to a column definition, then the primary key for
the table consists of that single column. Or, if a PRIMARY KEY clause is
specified as a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/table-constraint.html"
target="_blank">table-constraint</a>, then the primary key of the table
consists of the list of columns specified as part of the PRIMARY KEY
clause. The PRIMARY KEY clause must contain only column names â€” the use
of expressions in an
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/indexed-column.html"
target="_blank">indexed-column</a> of a PRIMARY KEY is not supported. An
error is raised if more than one PRIMARY KEY clause appears in a CREATE
TABLE statement. The PRIMARY KEY is optional for ordinary tables but is
required for <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html"
target="_blank">WITHOUT ROWID</a> tables.

If a table has a single column primary key and the declared type of that
column is "INTEGER" and the table is not a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html"
target="_blank">WITHOUT ROWID</a> table, then the column is known as an
[INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable#rowid). See
[below](lang_createtable#rowid) for a description of the special
properties and behaviors associated with an [INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY](lang_createtable#rowid).

Each row in a table with a primary key must have a unique combination of
values in its primary key columns. For the purposes of determining the
uniqueness of primary key values, NULL values are considered distinct
from all other values, including other NULLs. If an
[INSERT](lang_insert) or [UPDATE](lang_update) statement attempts to
modify the table content so that two or more rows have identical primary
key values, that is a constraint violation.

According to the SQL standard, PRIMARY KEY should always imply NOT NULL.
Unfortunately, due to a bug in some early versions, this is not the case
in SQLite. Unless the column is an [INTEGER PRIMARY
KEY](lang_createtable#rowid) or the table is a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html"
target="_blank">WITHOUT ROWID</a> table or a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html"
target="_blank">STRICT</a> table or the column is declared NOT NULL,
SQLite allows NULL values in a PRIMARY KEY column. SQLite could be fixed
to conform to the standard, but doing so might break legacy
applications. Hence, it has been decided to merely document the fact
that SQLite allows NULLs in most PRIMARY KEY columns.
<span id="uniqueconst"></span>

## 3.6. UNIQUE constraints

A UNIQUE constraint is similar to a PRIMARY KEY constraint, except that
a single table may have any number of UNIQUE constraints. For each
UNIQUE constraint on the table, each row must contain a unique
combination of values in the columns identified by the UNIQUE
constraint. For the purposes of UNIQUE constraints, NULL values are
considered distinct from all other values, including other NULLs. As
with PRIMARY KEYs, a UNIQUE
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/table-constraint.html"
target="_blank">table-constraint</a> clause must contain only column
names â€” the use of expressions in an
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/indexed-column.html"
target="_blank">indexed-column</a> of a UNIQUE
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/table-constraint.html"
target="_blank">table-constraint</a> is not supported.

In most cases, UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints are implemented by
creating a unique index in the database. (The exceptions are [INTEGER
PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable#rowid) and PRIMARY KEYs on
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html"
target="_blank">WITHOUT ROWID</a> tables.) Hence, the following schemas
are logically equivalent:

1.  CREATE TABLE t1(a, b UNIQUE);

2.  CREATE TABLE t1(a, b PRIMARY KEY);

3.  CREATE TABLE t1(a, b);  
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX t1b ON t1(b);

<span id="ckconst"></span>

## 3.7. CHECK constraints

A CHECK constraint may be attached to a column definition or specified
as a table constraint. In practice it makes no difference. Each time a
new row is inserted into the table or an existing row is updated, the
expression associated with each CHECK constraint is evaluated and cast
to a NUMERIC value in the same way as a [CAST
expression](lang_expr#castexpr). If the result is zero (integer value 0
or real value 0.0), then a constraint violation has occurred. If the
CHECK expression evaluates to NULL, or any other non-zero value, it is
not a constraint violation. The expression of a CHECK constraint may not
contain a subquery.

CHECK constraints are only verified when the table is written, not when
it is read. Furthermore, verification of CHECK constraints can be
temporarily disabled using the "<a
href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_ignore_check_constraints"
target="_blank">PRAGMA ignore_check_constraints=ON;</a>" statement.
Hence, it is possible that a query might produce results that violate
the CHECK constraints. <span id="notnullconst"></span>

## 3.8. NOT NULL constraints

A NOT NULL constraint may only be attached to a column definition, not
specified as a table constraint. Not surprisingly, a NOT NULL constraint
dictates that the associated column may not contain a NULL value.
Attempting to set the column value to NULL when inserting a new row or
updating an existing one causes a constraint violation. NOT NULL
constraints are not verified during queries, so a query of a column
might produce a NULL value even though the column is marked as NOT NULL,
if the database file is corrupt.

## 4. Constraint enforcement

Constraints are checked during [INSERT](lang_insert) and
[UPDATE](lang_update) and by
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check"
target="_blank">PRAGMA integrity_check</a> and
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_quick_check"
target="_blank">PRAGMA quick_check</a> and sometimes by [ALTER
TABLE](lang_altertable). Queries and [DELETE](lang_delete) statements do
not normally verify constraints. Hence, if a database file has been
corrupted (perhaps by an external program making direct changes to the
database file without going through the SQLite library) a query might
return data that violates a constraint. For example:

<div class="codeblock">

    CREATE TABLE t1(x INT CHECK( x>3 ));
    /* Insert a row with X less than 3 by directly writing into the
    ** database file using an external program */
    PRAGMA integrity_check;  -- Reports row with x less than 3 as corrupt
    INSERT INTO t1(x) VALUES(2);  -- Fails with SQLITE_CORRUPT
    SELECT x FROM t1;  -- Returns an integer less than 3 in spite of the CHECK constraint

</div>

Enforcement of CHECK constraints can be temporarily disabled using the
<a
href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_ignore_check_constraints"
target="_blank">PRAGMA ignore_check_constraints=ON;</a> statement.

## 4.1. Response to constraint violations

The response to a constraint violation is determined by the [constraint
conflict resolution algorithm](lang_conflict). Each PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE,
NOT NULL and CHECK constraint has a default conflict resolution
algorithm. PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints may be
explicitly assigned another default conflict resolution algorithm by
including a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/conflict-clause.html"
target="_blank">conflict-clause</a> in their definitions. Or, if a
constraint definition does not include a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/syntax/conflict-clause.html"
target="_blank">conflict-clause</a>, the default conflict resolution
algorithm is ABORT. The conflict resolution algorithm for CHECK
constraints is always ABORT. (For historical compatibility only, table
CHECK constraints are allowed to have a conflict resolution clause, but
that has no effect.) Different constraints within the same table may
have different default conflict resolution algorithms. See the section
titled [ON CONFLICT](lang_conflict) for additional information.
<span id="rowid"></span>

## 5. ROWIDs and the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY

Except for <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html"
target="_blank">WITHOUT ROWID</a> tables, all rows within SQLite tables
have a 64-bit signed integer key that uniquely identifies the row within
its table. This integer is usually called the "rowid". The rowid value
can be accessed using one of the special case-independent names "rowid",
"oid", or "\_rowid\_" in place of a column name. If a table contains a
user defined column named "rowid", "oid" or "\_rowid\_", then that name
always refers the explicitly declared column and cannot be used to
retrieve the integer rowid value.

The rowid (and "oid" and "\_rowid\_") is omitted in
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html"
target="_blank">WITHOUT ROWID</a> tables. WITHOUT ROWID tables are only
available in SQLite
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_8_2.html"
target="_blank">version 3.8.2</a> (2013-12-06) and later. A table that
lacks the WITHOUT ROWID clause is called a "rowid table".

The data for rowid tables is stored as a B-Tree structure containing one
entry for each table row, using the rowid value as the key. This means
that retrieving or sorting records by rowid is fast. Searching for a
record with a specific rowid, or for all records with rowids within a
specified range is around twice as fast as a similar search made by
specifying any other PRIMARY KEY or indexed value.

With one exception noted below, if a rowid table has a primary key that
consists of a single column and the declared type of that column is
"INTEGER" in any mixture of upper and lower case, then the column
becomes an alias for the rowid. Such a column is usually referred to as
an "integer primary key". A PRIMARY KEY column only becomes an integer
primary key if the declared type name is exactly "INTEGER". Other
integer type names like "INT" or "BIGINT" or "SHORT INTEGER" or
"UNSIGNED INTEGER" causes the primary key column to behave as an
ordinary table column with integer
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity"
target="_blank">affinity</a> and a unique index, not as an alias for the
rowid.

The exception mentioned above is that if the declaration of a column
with declared type "INTEGER" includes an "PRIMARY KEY DESC" clause, it
does not become an alias for the rowid and is not classified as an
integer primary key. This quirk is not by design. It is due to a bug in
early versions of SQLite. But fixing the bug could result in backwards
incompatibilities. Hence, the original behavior has been retained (and
documented) because odd behavior in a corner case is far better than a
compatibility break. This means that the following three table
declarations all cause the column "x" to be an alias for the rowid (an
integer primary key):

- `CREATE TABLE t(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY ASC, y, z);`
- `CREATE TABLE t(x INTEGER, y, z, PRIMARY KEY(x ASC));`
- `CREATE TABLE t(x INTEGER, y, z, PRIMARY KEY(x DESC));`

But the following declaration does not result in "x" being an alias for
the rowid:

- `CREATE TABLE t(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DESC, y, z);`

Rowid values may be modified using an UPDATE statement in the same way
as any other column value can, either using one of the built-in aliases
("rowid", "oid" or "\_rowid\_") or by using an alias created by an
integer primary key. Similarly, an INSERT statement may provide a value
to use as the rowid for each row inserted. Unlike normal SQLite columns,
an integer primary key or rowid column must contain integer values.
Integer primary key or rowid columns are not able to hold floating point
values, strings, BLOBs, or NULLs.

If an UPDATE statement attempts to set an integer primary key or rowid
column to a NULL or blob value, or to a string or real value that cannot
be losslessly converted to an integer, a "datatype mismatch" error
occurs and the statement is aborted. If an INSERT statement attempts to
insert a blob value, or a string or real value that cannot be losslessly
converted to an integer into an integer primary key or rowid column, a
"datatype mismatch" error occurs and the statement is aborted.

If an INSERT statement attempts to insert a NULL value into a rowid or
integer primary key column, the system chooses an integer value to use
as the rowid automatically. A detailed description of how this is done
is provided <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html"
target="_blank">separately</a>.

The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#parentchild"
target="_blank">parent key</a> of a
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html"
target="_blank">foreign key constraint</a> is not allowed to use the
rowid. The parent key must used named columns only.
