In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and React Native by building a simple application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database.

---

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
   - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://sqlitecloud.io/register) and create a new database.
   - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.
2. **Create a React Native app**
    - Create a React Native app using officially recommended framework Expo with the following command:
```bash
  npx create-expo-app@latest
```
  - After creating your project, navigate to the project directory and install the SQLite Cloud SDK:
```bash
  npm install @sqlitecloud/drivers
```

3. **Add data and service layers**
    - Create a folder named `db`, then create a file in that folder named `database.js`. This file will be responsible for instantiating the database connection:
```javascript
import { Database } from '@sqlitecloud/drivers';

const db = new Database('<your-connection-string>');

export default db;
```
  - Next, create a folder named `services` in the root directory of your project. Create a file named `albums.js` within the `services` folder. This file will be responsible for querying data from the database:
```javascript
import db from '../db/database';

export const getAlbums = async () => {
  const result = await db.exec`
    USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite;
    SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, albums.name as artist
    FROM albums
    INNER JOIN artists
    WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
    LIMIT 20;`;
  return result.fetchall();
};
```
4. **Create a React Native component**
  - Navigate to the index.js file in the /app/(tabs) directory and replace the existing code with the following code:
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { getAlbums } from './services/albums';

export default function HomeScreen() {
  const [albums, setAlbums] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getAlbums().then((data) => setAlbums(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Albums</Text>
      {albums.map((album) => (
        <Text key={album.id}>{album.title} by {album.artist}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

5. **Run your app**
  - Start your React Native app using the following command:
```bash
  npm start
```
  - Open your Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code to view your app.

And that's it! You've successfully built a React Native app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
