This powerful package provides methods that perform database operations and enable real-time notifications in Swift apps, making it easier than ever to work with SQLite in the cloud.

## Install

  - In `Package.swift`, add the `swift` package to `dependencies`. The following example snippet is from a project using the Vapor framework.

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
  dependencies: [
    ...
    .package(url: "https://github.com/sqlitecloud/swift.git", from: "0.2.1")
  ],
  targets: [
    .executableTarget(
      ...
      dependencies: [
          ...
          .product(name: "SQLiteCloud", package: "swift")
      ],
      ...
    ),
  ]
)
```

## Basic Usage

  - 

```swift
import SQLiteCloud

# explicit 
let configuration = SQLiteCloudConfig(hostname: "<see-project-deployment>", username: "<see-settings-users>", password: "<edit-your-user>", port: .default)
```

```python
import sqlitecloud

# Open the connection to SQLite Cloud
conn = sqlitecloud.connect("sqlitecloud://myhost.sqlite.cloud:8860?apikey=myapikey")

# You can autoselect the database during the connect call
# by adding the database name as path of the SQLite Cloud
# connection string, eg:
# conn = sqlitecloud.connect("sqlitecloud://myhost.sqlite.cloud:8860/mydatabase?apikey=myapikey")
db_name = "chinook.sqlite"
conn.execute(f"USE DATABASE {db_name}")

cursor = conn.execute("SELECT * FROM albums WHERE AlbumId = ?", (1, ))
result = cursor.fetchone()

print(result)

conn.close()
```
