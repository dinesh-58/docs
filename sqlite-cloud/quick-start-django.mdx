In this quickstart, we will show you how to get started with SQLite Cloud and Django by building a simple application that connects to and reads from a SQLite Cloud database, and returns the result to a lightweight client.

1. **Set up a SQLite Cloud account**
  - If you haven't already, [sign up for a SQLite Cloud account](https://sqlitecloud.io/register) and create a new database.
  - In this guide, we will use the sample datasets that come pre-loaded with SQLite Cloud.

2. **Create a Django app**
  - Create a Django app using the following command:
```bash
django-admin startproject sqlitecloud_quickstart
```
  - Create a new app within the project:
```bash
cd sqlitecloud_quickstart
python manage.py startapp quickstart
```

3. **Install the SQLite Cloud SDK**
```bash
pip install sqlitecloud
```

4. **Query data**
  - Grab a connection string by clicking on a node in your dashboard.
  - Create a file `services.py` within the quickstart directory. Use the following code to display data from your database.

```python
import sqlitecloud

# Create your models here.
db = sqlitecloud.connect('<your-connection-string>')

def get_albums():
  result = db.execute('''
  USE DATABASE chinook.sqlite; 
  SELECT albums.AlbumId as id, albums.Title as title, artists.name as artist
  FROM albums 
  INNER JOIN artists 
  WHERE artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId
  LIMIT 20;
  ''')
  return result.fetchall()

```
  - Use the following code to display the data in a Django view:
```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .services import get_albums

def albums(request):
    data = get_albums()
    return JsonResponse(data, safe=False)
```
  - Add the following URL pattern to your project's `urls.py` file:
```python
from django.urls import path
from quickstart import albums

urlpatterns = [
    path('albums/', albums),
]
```
  - Run the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
  - Visit `http://localhost:8000/albums/` to see the data returned from your SQLite Cloud database.

And that's it! You've successfully built a Django app that reads data from a SQLite Cloud database.
