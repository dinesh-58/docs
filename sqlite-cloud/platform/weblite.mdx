Weblite consists of an autogenerated HTTP/JSON REST API for programmatically interacting with SQLite Cloud. 

It is the simplest way to add a robust database backend to your application.

## Overview
First, navigate to the Weblite panel from the left-hand navigation menu.

From here, you'll find a list of APIs you can use to interact with your SQLite Cloud instance, including:
- **Services**: Endpoints for health checks, metrics, and more.
- **Weblite**: Endpoints for executing SQLiteCloudArrayType, and interacting with datbases and tables.
- **Functions**: Endpoints for executing SQLite functions.
- **Webhooks**: Endpoints for creating and managing webhooks.
- **Files**: Endpoints for uploading and downloading files.
