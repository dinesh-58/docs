In a role-based access control system, a privilege represents a specific action or permission that a user or role is allowed to perform within the system.
It defines what a user can or cannot do, such as reading, writing, or managing certain resources like tables, databases, or settings.
Essentially, a privilege is a **right** or **ability** granted to a user or role, specifying their level of access and control over the system's resources.

A privilege can be [granted](https://docs.sqlitecloud.io/docs/commands/grant-privilege), [revoked](https://docs.sqlitecloud.io/docs/commands/revoke-privilege) and [assigned](https://docs.sqlitecloud.io/docs/commands/set-privilege) to a given role.
A role can contains any combination of privileges.
