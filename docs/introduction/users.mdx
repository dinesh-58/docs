SQLite Cloud provides secure access to resources through role-based authorization, which ensures user isolation and enhances security and manageability. In SQLite Cloud, roles serve as the foundation blocks for user access, and the level of user access to the database system is determined by the assigned roles. Users have no access to the system outside the designated roles.

To add new users to your cluster, simply click on the **Create User** button.

Once a user is successfully created, you can assign one or more roles to them to determine their level of access to the system.
