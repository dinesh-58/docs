API KEYs can be used as an alternative authentication mechanism. Authentication through API keys ensures the same privileges as the user to which they are associated. API KEYs are recommended for all server-to-server authentication cases and are necessary for using the [REST APIs](/docs/introduction/api) and the [SDK](/docs/sdk) that uses the WebSocket APIs.

To create an API key for a user, click on the **Create API KEY** button.
