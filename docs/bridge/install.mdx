All the communications between the clients and the cluster are encrypted, and so you must link the [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org) (libtls) library with your code.

### Install LibreSSL

#### **Linux:**

- Download the latest portable source from [www.libressl.org](https://www.libressl.org/)
- Extract the tarball and change the directory to the libressl dir
- Compile and install LibreSSL. By default, the install script will install LibreSSL to the `/usr/local/` folder. In order to avoid issue with other SSL libraries installed on the system, you can specify a different install directory, for example `/usr/local/libressl`, with the following command:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/libressl --with-openssldir=/usr/local/libressl && make && make install
```

#### **macOS:**

```bash
brew install libressl
```

or you can compile and install from the source code using the same Linux instructions.


#### **Windows:**

Follow the [official LibreSSL build instructions](https://github.com/libressl/portable).
