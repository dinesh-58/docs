## Syntax

LISTEN [TABLE] **channel_name** [DATABASE **database_name**]

## Privileges

```
SUB
```

## Description

The LISTEN command is used to start receiving notifications for a given channel/table.
Nothing is done if the current connection is registered as a listener for this notification channel.
The optional DATABASE parameter is ignored if the TABLE flag is not specified.


The optional TABLE flag specifies that you want to receive notification for a given table. The DATABASE parameter can be used to identify which database to use (or the current database will be used).
LISTENING to a table means you'll receive notification about all the write operations in that table.
In the case of TABLE, the channel_name can be *, which means you'll start receiving notifications from all the tables inside the specified database.

## Return

OK string or error value (see [SCSP](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol).

## Example

```bash
> LISTEN channel1
OK
```
