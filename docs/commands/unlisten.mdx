In the case of TABLE, the channel_name can be *, meaning you'll stop receiving notifications from all the tables inside the current database.
The DATABASE parameter can be used to identify which database to use (or the current database will be used).
The optional DATABASE parameter is ignored if the TABLE flag is not specified.

> UNLISTEN channel1
OK
