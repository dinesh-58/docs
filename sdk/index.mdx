SQLite Cloud offers SDKs for the most popular client and server-side frameworks, making it easy for you to implement any solution, whatever your tech stack looks like.

SDK and libraries are open-source with code hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk). To communicate with the core server all the libraries implement the [SQLite Cloud Serialization Protocol](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md).
