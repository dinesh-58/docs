In SQLite Cloud, a role is a set of permissions that allows a user to perform specific actions on a particular resource, such as a database or table. Users can have multiple roles, which determine their access to the system.

You can assign roles to users in two ways: when creating a new user account, or when updating the roles of an existing user.

There are two types of roles in SQLite Cloud:

- **Built-In Roles.** These roles are pre-defined by SQLite Cloud to provide commonly needed privileges in a database system. Built-in roles grant permissions on any database.

- **User-Defined Roles.** If the built-in roles do not provide the necessary privileges or if you need to grant permissions for a specific set of resources, you can define custom roles using the **CREATE ROLE** button. These roles are called user-defined roles.
