title: CREATE CHANNEL
description: The CREATE CHANNEL command creates a new Pub/Sub environment channel
---

## Syntax

CREATE CHANNEL **channel_name** [IF NOT EXISTS]

## Privileges

```
PUBSUBCREATE
```

## Description

The CREATE CHANNEL command creates a new Pub/Sub environment channel.
It is usually an error to attempt to create a new channel if another one exists with the same name. However, if the "IF NOT EXISTS" clause is specified as part of the CREATE CHANNEL statement, and a channel of the same name already exists, the CREATE CHANNEL command has no effect (and no error message is returned). An error is still returned if the channel cannot be created for any other reason, even if the "IF NOT EXISTS" clause is specified.

## Return

OK string or error value (see [SCSP](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol).

## Example

```bash
> CREATE CHANNEL channel1 IF NOT EXISTS
OK
```
