## Syntax

TRANSFER LEADERSHIP TO NODE **nodeid**

## Privileges

```
CLUSTERADMIN
```

## Description

The TRANSFER LEADERSHIP TO NODE command is rarely used (primarily for debugging purposes), but it can force Raft to change its leader node to a specific nodeid. The leader node is responsible for all the write operations, so it is wise to force the most powerful node to be the leader of a Raft cluster.

## Return

OK string or error value (see [SCSP](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol).

## Example

```bash
> GET LEADER ID
1

> TRANSFER LEADERSHIP TO NODE 3
OK

> GET LEADER ID
3
```
