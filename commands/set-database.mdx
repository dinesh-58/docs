description: Use this command to set a specific key/value setting to database_name
---

## Syntax

SET DATABASE **database_name** KEY **keyname** TO **keyvalue**

## Privileges

```
PRAGMA
```

## Description

Use this command to set a specific key/value setting to **database_name**.

You can use any key/value, but some keys are reserved for a special purpose:
* use_concurrent_transactions: set to 1 or 0 to enable/disable CONCURRENT transaction for the database
* DATABASE_KEY: set to the encryption key used to decrypt the database file. Note that this is not equivalent to encrypting a database. This value must be used to set an encryption key for an already encrypted database.

## Return

OK string or error value (see [SCSP](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol).

## Example

```bash
> SET DATABASE mediastore.sqlite KEY key1 VALUE value1
OK
```
