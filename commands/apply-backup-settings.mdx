## Syntax

APPLY BACKUP SETTINGS

## Privileges

```
BACKUP
```

## Description

Several backup-related settings can be applied using the SET DATABASE KEY command.

The following keys affect the backup settings:
* **backup**: set to 1 to activate a backup, 0 to disable.
* **backup_retention**: affects the disk space needed to store backup information about a specific database. You can specify a `backup_retention` settings using values like 24h, 2.5h, or 2h45m.
* **backup_snapshot_interval**: specifies how often new snapshots will be created. This setting reduces the time to restore since newer snapshots will have fewer WAL frames to apply.

All the above settings are not immediately applied up-until an APPLY BACKUP SETTINGS command is executed.

## Return

OK string or error value (see [SCSP](https://github.com/sqlitecloud/sdk/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol).

## Example

```bash
> APPLY BACKUP SETTINGS
OK
```
